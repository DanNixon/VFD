This repository contains a design for an IV-11 based Vacuum Fluorescent Display (VFD) display unit.

Key points of the design:

Parts count/prices kept down by using 'generic' ebay modules to provide:

* DS3231 Real Time Clock
* Boost converter module to provide the ~25VDC to power the VFD
* Buck converter module to provide 1.5v to heat the cathodes
* Wemos D1 Mini board to provide the brains
* 5mm encapsulated addressable RGB LEDs to provide the colour effects.

Please see the project wiki for more details.
